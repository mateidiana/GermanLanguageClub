# German Language Club
This repository contains a collaborative java application for managing the registration and evaluation 
of the participants in a language club for learning German. Besides the students, the app tracks the 
teachers of the German classes. A student can register to one or more classes, each class tackling specific 
skills, namely reading, vocabulary, grammar and writing. A student can participate in a particular class via 
the registration process, taking into account that each class has a limited number of places and each 
student can only register once. A student can also take an exam for one class and receive a score. A teacher 
on the other hand is assigned a single class which they can modify (add exercises to/ delete exercises from).
Teachers can also create or delete exams for their respective class. Overall, this app handles a real life 
scenario of managing a learning setting for students, teachers and learning materials.
